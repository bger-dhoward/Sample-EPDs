This LCA was conducted to 1) better understand the environmental impacts of the life cycle of suspended ceiling systems; 2) learn how the impacts of raw material selection, product formulation, and manufacturing process influence the life cycle impacts of suspended ceilings, and 3) use innovation to drive reduction in the product platform. The methods for conducting the life cycle assessments used for this project were consistent with ISO 14040 and 14044. This report is intended to fulfill the reporting requirements in Section 5 of ISO 14044 and Product Category Rules Guidance for Building-Related Products and Services UL速 Environments (2021) Part B: Non-Metal Ceiling Panel EPD Requirements. Emissions associated with transportation were determined by capturing the average transportation distances and modes for inbound raw materials, distribution to installation, and end-of-life disposal. Energy use and the associated emissions were calculated using pre-configured transportation models from the GaBi database.","program_operator_doc_id":"(Part A and B)
