Product System Documentation 1.1 Product Description and Product Identification 5/8 in. (15.9 mm) Sheetrock® Brand EcoSmart Panels Firecode 30® (UL Type FC30) represent a revolution in wallboard manufacturing, reducing the use of natural resources and impact on the environment. These lightweight 5/8 in. (15.9 mm) gypsum panels have been formulated to achieve all of the same strength and physical performance characteristics as standard 5/8 in. (15.9 mm) Sheetrock® Brand Firecode® X Panels at a lower environmental impact and reduced weight. They feature an innovative noncombustible gypsum core that is encased in 100% recycled face and back papers that form a high strength-to-weight ratio composite design. The face paper is folded around the long edges to reinforce and protect the core, and the ends are cut square and even. The long edges of panels are tapered, allowing joints to be reinforced and concealed with Sheetrock® Brand joint treatment systems. The panels are UL Classiﬁed for ﬁre resistance and can be used in any UL Design in which Type FC30 panels are listed. On the face along the long edge of each panel, the UL Type Designation is printed for easy identiﬁcation by building inspectors. 1.2 Designated Application Commercial or residential applications where 5/8 in. (15.9 mm) Type X panels are not required for steel- or woodframed wall and ceiling assemblies New or repair and remodel construction Single-layer wood- or steel-framed 30-minute fire-rated wall assemblies Double-layer steel-framed 1-hour fire-rated wall assemblies 1.3 Product Technical Data Table 1: Summary of the technical data Technical Data Safety Data Sheet - Yes/No Noncombustibility Surface-burning characteristics Flame spread Smoke developed Class A Core hardness Field End Edge Flexural strength Parallel Perpendicular Humidified deflection, gypsum Nail pull resistance 1.
