Nexus Cushion Modular carpet tile styles are made with nylon or PET face fiber. This EPD includes results for Encore® SD Ultima® Nylon-25% post-industrial recycled nylon, Encore®100 Nylon-100% post-industrial recycled nylon, and TeraPlex® SD polyester fiber. Nexus® Cushion modular carpet tiles feature a high-performance polyurethane cushion. A representative product within the Nexus® Cushion family was chosen. The composition within the Nexus® Cushion Modular family of products does not differ other than pigments and patterns used to give each style of carpet tile its own distinct appearance. The variation in terms of pigments used is less than 5% of the total product weight and is excluded from the study. This EPD covers all styles and colors under the Nexus® Cushion Modular product family utilizing the yarn systems covered. Specific products can be found on J+J’s website. Each style, combined with our Nexus® Cushion Modular backing, continues our over 55-year tradition of combining performance and appealing design. Pair your imagination with our comprehensive product choices on your next project and create your own dramatic statement.
